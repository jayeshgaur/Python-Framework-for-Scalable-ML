Welcome to Simple Classifier's documentation!
=============================================

Introducing "Simple Classifier", a user-friendly library designed for individuals new to
machine learning and seeking an accessible way to explore and experiment with various
classification algorithms. This library streamlines the entire machine learning process,
from data preparation and preprocessing to training, evaluation, and comparison of different
algorithms, without requiring extensive coding knowledge.

Simple Classifier not only allows
users to easily customize the splitting method for their specific needs, but also performs
hyperparameter tuning to find the most optimal parameters for each model. With a comprehensive
performance comparison, users can effortlessly identify the best algorithm for their dataset,
making this library an essential tool for those starting their journey in machine learning.
